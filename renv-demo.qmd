## Goals for today

- Why use renv?
- How to use it

## Your project depends on its dependencies

To state the obvious :sweat_smile: Let's concentrate on software dependencies.

. . .

R packages evolve over time.

. . .

Some of them come from CRAN, others from R-universe, others from GitHub.

## Future users of your code

including yourself :wink: should be able to use the same packages and their same versions to re-run your code.

## Ever used `sessionInfo()` to list dependencies?

. . .

You were on the right track.

. . .

renv is a better way to do that, with :sparkles: little overhead :sparkles:
